# SLAIF LOCAL CODING — NORMATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE (compact)

Read before mutation. Full `ARCHITECTURE.md` is human-facing rationale; this
file is the default complete normative implementation map. Conflict/ambiguity:
stop and return to strategy; never choose weaker law.

## Mission and boundary

Private adapter makes ordinary Codex/OpenAI clients reliable against constrained
local models. Production path:

```text
client -> slaif-api-gateway -> this adapter -> private vLLM/Qwen
```

Gateway is separate repo and owns public keys, permissions, quotas, accounting,
routes, admin/TLS. This repo owns model-specific request adaptation,
constitutional compilation/cache/injection, local-model packaging/tests. Never
merge these responsibilities or copy gateway code silently.

## Required stack

Python 3.12; `uv` locked/frozen; FastAPI/Starlette ASGI; HTTPX async streaming;
Pydantic settings/contracts; Uvicorn; pytest/pytest-asyncio + fake upstream;
Ruff + mypy; Prometheus-compatible private metrics. Separate repo venv; no torch,
model loading, image decode, or duplicate vLLM process in adapter.

## APIs

Own `/healthz`, `/readyz`, private `/metrics`. Faithfully proxy at least
`/health`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/chat/completions`. Preserve
status/errors/ordinary function tools/usage/SSE order/disconnect; no response
buffering. Parse bounded JSON only where transformation applies. Remove
hop-by-hop and spoofed internal headers. No raw payload logging.

## Ordered request pipeline

1. Build trusted request context: request ID, endpoint, route/model, opaque
   principal, session discriminator, streaming, internal compiler-bypass.
2. Select validated explicit route policy.
3. Apply image policy.
4. Observe/compile constitutional state.
5. Select bounded working constitution.
6. Inject idempotently in API-valid stable location.
7. Forward privately to vLLM and stream response.
8. Emit safe count/timing metrics only.

Compiler calls bypass this pipeline and call upstream directly; never recurse.

## Image law

Route declares `max_images_per_request` and policy
`retain_newest|reject|passthrough`. For designated Qwen Codex vision route:
max=1, `retain_newest`. Support Responses `input_image` and Chat `image_url`;
zero/one unchanged; multiple retain exactly newest content item and preserve all
other order/content. Verify final count. Unknown over-limit shape fails closed.
Never apply globally. Explicit multi-image comparison is unsupported on this
route; use reject route, never claim semantic equivalence.

Existing localhost proxy is reference/proven behavior only. Integrate its pure
algorithm into shared adapter; no separate client proxy in final topology.

## Constitution law

`AGENTS.md` is constitutional root only when envelope/path evidence supports it:
Codex project-instruction marker, input-file filename, or paired file-read tool
result. Arbitrary mention is insufficient. Hash exact observed bytes.

Before model call deterministically enumerate candidate repository paths from
Markdown links, backticks/quotes/path-like strings and normative-neighbor text;
preserve every candidate+evidence; reject URL/absolute/traversal. Model may rank,
not silently erase candidates.

On source/compiler cache miss, one bounded text-only internal Qwen call returns
strict validated schema:

```text
source hash/version
compact rules with MUST/MUST_NOT/NEVER strength+evidence
roles/authority/source-of-truth/order/exceptions
candidate path
reference_confidence 0..1
constitutional_priority 0..100
class P0 root | P1 delegated law/security | P2 binding procedure |
      P3 architecture/contract | P4 background/example
relationship/evidence/acquisition urgency
full-source reread triggers
```

Never use one ambiguous score. Compiler has no tools/network/filesystem/gateway
key; treats source as data; max one concurrent call; strict size/time/output;
invalid output never cached valid.

Referenced content is unavailable until it crosses API boundary. Missing P0/P1
causes injected instruction to read exact file with ordinary Codex local tools
before substantive mutation. When paired path/content tool output arrives,
hash/compile/update graph incrementally. Adapter never reads client filesystem.

## Pseudo-context/cache law

Derived cache is disposable/non-authoritative. Repository/Git/GitHub and full
source override it.

```text
L0 bounded injected manifest
L1 compiled source indexes
L2 observed source text
L3 client repository/Git/GitHub authority
```

Default protected cache `/dev/shm/slaif-local-coding`, fallback protected XDG
cache; atomic files; dirs 0700/files 0600; content-addressed; hard total/per-entry
bytes; TTL+LRU; separate bounded pinned P0/P1. Identity includes opaque principal,
session/repository discriminator, source hash, compiler/schema/model/policy/
render versions. Never cross principals. Raw source persistence off by default.
Purge/rebuild must lose no authoritative information.

Working-set order: P0 root; acquired P1; missing P1 acquisition list; relevant
P2/P3 if budget. Stable deterministic ordering for prefix cache. Hard injected
byte limit. Marker says reconstructed context, sources authoritative. Inject on
every request, including after compaction. Do not expose cache mechanics/secrets.

Compiler/cache failure: preserve original governance-bearing request when safe;
never silently delete law. Image enforcement remains independent.

## Identity/security

Production external key terminates at gateway. Adapter accepts service auth plus
signed opaque principal/session/route; strips caller spoofing. Raw external key
never cache key. MVP single-user fallback may use principal+route+best session+
root hash; absent reliable identity means no cross-request reuse beyond current
observed content. Multi-user release requires signed identity contract.

Never log/store raw prompts, source, images, tool output, bodies, auth, keys,
cookies, private URLs. Metrics only counts/timings/states. Sanitize errors. Bound
body/source/output/cache. Cancel upstream on disconnect.

## Live-host protection

Canonical paths:

```text
REPO=/synology/homes/janezp/codex-work/slaif-local-coding
STRATEGIC=/synology/homes/janezp/codex-supervision/slaif-local-coding
QWEN=/synology/homes/janezp/qwen-serving
UPSTREAM=http://127.0.0.1:18020/v1
DEV_ADAPTER=127.0.0.1:18031
```

Verify live facts first; historical docs are evidence only. The canonical value
above is the preferred same-host upstream on `hinton1`; `http://10.8.132.75`
is the optional LAN alternative, while `http://10.8.132.76` is historical
provenance. No pre-existing image proxy or port-18021 service is assumed.
Development/candidate service MUST use
18031 unless a work order explicitly selects another free port. Without explicit
active service-mutation order NEVER stop/change `qwen-serving`, model/checkpoint/
patches, API-key files, systemd units, VPN/firewall/network binding, port 18020,
or launch flags. Passwordless sudo permits safe repo-local tools/services, not protected
fixture mutation. No direct public vLLM.

## Resource law

RTX 3090/24 GB tight: adapter CPU-only; one compiler call default; deduplicate
same misses; bounded live tests; no image decode/re-encode; stream bodies/
responses where possible; cache MB not GB; no duplicate model; backpressure/
timeout on saturation. Internal compiler overhead separately metered.

## Failure law

- upstream unavailable -> sanitized 502/503, readiness fail;
- malformed transform JSON -> explicit 4xx, no unsafe bypass;
- compiler error -> original semantics/fallback, no governance deletion;
- cache error -> operate unoptimized;
- over-limit image -> configured transform or deterministic reject;
- missing identity -> no cross-tenant reuse;
- disconnect -> close/cancel upstream;
- unknown policy/capability -> fail startup/readiness, not guess.

## Verification law

Required layers: pure unit; fake-upstream contract/SSE/errors/disconnect;
image zero/one/multiple; AGENTS detection/candidate evidence/schema/cache/
invalidation/budget/isolation/injection/failure; bounded live vLLM text/tool/
stream/multiturn/vision/two-image/compiler/cache; actual Codex long-AGENTS +
full-image→crop + compaction/history reduction; secret/raw-log scans.
Exact status labels; skipped/pending/missing/not-run never pass. Green CI required,
not sufficient.

## Packaging/cutover

Initial service on 18031 only. systemd template uses repo venv+protected env,
safe logs. OCI/Compose later. Separate explicit accepted cutover backs up old
unit/profile, tests candidate, switches gateway/profile, proves rollback, never
cuts off active coding turn. Model weights never in Git. Pin/provenance/license
all components; prominently credit Apache-2.0
`syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090`; preserve notices/modified-file markers.

## Planned objective boundaries

000 pass-through+image policy/live fixtures; 001 detection+deterministic paths;
002 compiler+cache; 003 injection/acquisition/rehydration; 004 real Codex+security/
ops; 005 gateway+cutover; 006 SME package/release. Strategy may revise only from
verified evidence. One numeric objective=one PR; coding never merges.
